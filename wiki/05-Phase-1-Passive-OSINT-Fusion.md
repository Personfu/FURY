# Chapter 05: Phase 1 — Passive OSINT Fusion

## The Art of Invisible Collection

Passive OSINT is the backbone of stealth intelligence. In this phase, we interact only with third-party aggregators, never the target directly.

### Fusion Sources

- **Search Engines**: Specialized dorks for `Google`, `Shodan`, and `Censys`.
- **Social Metadata**: `Holehe` for account checks; `Blackbird` for cross-platform footprint.
- **Public Repositories**: `Gitleaks` and `TruffleHog` for historical credential discovery.

### Intelligence Synthesis

We fuse these sources to build a "Digital Shadow" of the target. This phase creates the target list for subsequent, more active phases.
