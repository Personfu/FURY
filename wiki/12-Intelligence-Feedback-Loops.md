# Chapter 12: Intelligence Feedback Loops

## Continuous Learning and Hardening

The FURIOS-INT™ process is circular. Every engagement feeds the next.

### Creating the Loop

1. **Engagement Findings**: Documented exposures and validated risks.
2. **Defensive Hardening**: Applying findings to blue team rulesets.
3. **Intelligence Updating**: Updating our predictive models based on the target's response to the discovered risks.

### FURY Infrastructure Integration

By integrating FURY OSINT into the CI/CD pipeline, the feedback loop becomes automated, ensuring that every code change is analyzed for OSINT exposure before reaching production.
