## Branding, Legal & Ethics

**FURIOS-INT™** — Furulie Unified Reconnaissance & Intelligence-Oriented OSINT — is a predictive intelligence discipline created by **FLLC**. This manual is Volume I: From Public Data to Predictive Security Intelligence.

### Preface

This manual is designed for senior security engineers, threat intelligence analysts, red and blue team leads, CISOs, and technical leadership operating in enterprise, federal, and regulated environments. It defines the "FURY Way" of performing intelligence-driven operations.

### Legal & Ethical Framework

All techniques described herein assume:

- **Explicit Written Authorization**: No work is performed without a signed SOW or ROE.
- **Defined Scope Boundaries**: Clear understanding of what is and isn't a target.
- **Legal Counsel Review**: Compliance with local, federal, and international laws.
- **Audit Trail Maintenance**: Every action is logged for accountability.

### Core Ethical Principles

1. **Authorization First**: Never touch a system without clear permission.
2. **Minimal Footprint**: Passive over active; stealth over noise.
3. **Data Stewardship**: Protecting collected intelligence with the same rigor as production data.
4. **Transparency in Reporting**: Delivering unbiased, evidence-based intelligence.
5. **Continuous Legal Awareness**: Monitoring changes in data privacy and cyber law (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
