# Chapter 04: Phase 0 — Mission Framing

## Establishing Scope and Intent

The most critical part of an engagement happens before a single tool is run. **Phase 0** is about framing.

### Engagement Goals

- **Inventory/Discovery**: What do we own?
- **Exposure Analysis**: What are we showing?
- **Risk Assessment**: What is our liability?

### Rules of Engagement

- **Avoid Collateral Damage**: Ensure identifiers (IPs, domains) are strictly within the client path.
- **Stealth Requirements**: Are we testing the SoC's detection capabilities?
- **Reporting Tiers**: Operational (Technical), Tactical (Managers), Strategic (Leadership).
