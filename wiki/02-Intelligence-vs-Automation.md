# Chapter 02: Intelligence vs Automation

## The Human-Machine Synthesis

Automation is a force multiplier, not a replacement for intelligence. In **FURIOS-INT™**, we distinguish between "Collection Automation" and "Cognitive Intelligence."

### The Automation Trap

Relying solely on tools leads to data fatigue and high false-positive rates. The analyst must remain the orchestrator.

### The FURY Workflow

1. **Automated Discovery**: Use tools like `Spiderfoot` and `Osmedeus` to cast a wide net.
2. **Machine Correlation**: Leveraging `Axiom` to parallelize scanning across distributed nodes.
3. **Analyst Synthesis**: The human operative filters the results to identify actual signals of risk.
