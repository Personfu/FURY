# Chapter 09: Predictive Threat Modeling

## Anticipating Future Attack Vectors

Predictive modeling is the peak of **FURIOS-INT™**. We don't just find vulnerabilities; we predict them.

### The Prediction Engine

- **Historical Analysis**: Studying a target's history of patches and breaches.
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Analyzing developer commit patterns and infrastructure growth.
- **Dependency Forecasting**: Tracking upstream library vulnerabilities before they reach the target.

### Implementing Predictions

Using `fury-synth`, we generate hypothetical attack scenarios based on real-time OSINT data, allowing leadership to harden defenses before an attacker even identifies the vector.
