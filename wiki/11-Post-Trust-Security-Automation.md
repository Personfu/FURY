# Chapter 11: Post-Trust Security & Automation

## Operating in Zero-Trust Environments

In a post-trust world, identity is the new perimeter. OSINT moves from discovering systems to discovering and validating identities.

### Identity-Oriented OSINT

- **Credential Analysis**: Using `fury-git` (via Gitleaks/TruffleHog) to find legitimate identity markers.
- **Social Graphing**: Building an understanding of internal identity relationships using public social data.
- **Zero-Trust Validation**: Verifying if "Zero Trust" architectures are indeed implemented by testing identity-based access exposures found via OSINT.

### Automation in Post-Trust

Automation must be identity-aware. Our scripts don't just find ports; they find the identities authorized to access those ports and validate their security posture.
