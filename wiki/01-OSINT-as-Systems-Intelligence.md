# Chapter 01: OSINT as Systems Intelligence

## Understanding Modern Data Surfaces

OSINT is no longer just about Google dorks and social media footprint. In the **FURY** philosophy, OSINT is **Systems Intelligence**. Every piece of data is a node in a larger, interconnected system.

### The Shift to Systems Intelligence

Traditional OSINT focuses on "what" can be found. FURIOS-INT™ focuses on "how" that data reveals structural dependencies, hidden infrastructure, and organizational behavior.

### Target Surfaces

1. **The Infrastructure Surface**: Cloud footprints, ASN relationships, and shadow IT.
2. **The Human Surface**: Developer patterns, credential leakage, and social engineering vectors.
3. **The Logical Surface**: Application logic leaks, API responses, and metadata hierarchies.

### Leveraging FURY Tools

- **Amass & Subfinder**: Mapping the technical infrastructure surface.
- **Nuclei**: Detecting logical exposure via template-driven scanning.
- **Spiderfoot**: Automating the correlation between disparate data nodes.
