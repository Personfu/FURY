# Chapter 08: Beyond CVEs — Vulnerability Intelligence

## Contextual Risk Analysis

A high-severity CVE might be "Low Risk" in a specific environment, while a "Low" severity misconfiguration might be "Critical." This is **Vulnerability Intelligence**.

### Contextual Factors

- **Network Position**: Is the vulnerable service air-gapped or internet-facing?
- **Data Sensitivity**: What data does the vulnerable system have access to?
- **Compensating Controls**: Are there WAFs, IPSs, or EDRs active?

### FURY-Driven Insights

By using `Osquery` alongside OSINT data, we can cross-reference external exposure with internal system state, providing a 360-degree view of the actual risk.
