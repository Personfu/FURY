# Chapter 03: Threat Modeling for OSINT

## Modernizing the Threat Surface

Threat modeling in OSINT requires understanding how an attacker views a target from the outside in. We use the **STRIDE** model applied specifically to public intelligence.

### OSINT-Specific Threat Vectors

- **Spoofing**: Can an attacker mimic an official asset found via OSINT?
- **Information Disclosure**: What sensitive metadata is being leaked?
- **Reputation Damage**: Does the current footprint invite predatory behavior?

### Predictive Modeling

By analyzing current exposure, we can predict a target's next likely vulnerability. If a developer leaks a specific library version on GitHub, we model the exploitation of that library before it is even deployed.
