# Chapter 10: Quantum Computing Implications

## The Post-Quantum OSINT Landscape

The advent of viable quantum computing will fundamentally alter the OSINT landscape, specifically regarding historical data encryption.

### The store-now, decrypt-later (SNDL) Threat

Attackers are currently collecting encrypted OSINT artifacts with the intent to decrypt them once quantum scale is achieved.

### FURY's Post-Quantum Readiness

- **PQC Algorithms**: Implementing Post-Quantum Cryptography for internal intelligence storage.
- **Crypto-Intelligence**: Monitoring the exposure of "quantum-vulnerable" infrastructure and advising on transition timelines.
- **Algorithm Agility**: Ensuring the FURY toolset can easily pivot to new cryptographic standards as they emerge.
